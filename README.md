Aggregator platform — public disclosure, investor proposition, value proposition, and funding requirements

Public disclosure for the GitHub repository

• Scope: This repository contains the modular Aggregator Platform: a gateway, function services, manifests, and widget components enabling partners to embed composable applications (voting, rating, tipping, wagering, competitions, chat, messaging) with consent‑first governance.
• License and contributions: Code, manifests, and docs are provided under the project’s license. Contributions are welcome via issues and pull requests. Include tests, manifests, and compliance notes when submitting new functions.
• Compliance‑sensitive modules: Wagering, escrow, and payments are toggle‑gated and must be deployed in accordance with local regulations. Partners are responsible for enabling KYC/AML and regional residency where applicable.
• Consent‑first design: Every function declares data scopes, purpose, retention, and residency in a signed manifest. Users receive revocable consent tokens; the gateway enforces purpose binding and audit trails.
• Security posture: CI/CD includes dependency scanning, SBOM generation, and image signing. Runtime enforces least‑privilege scopes and policy checks at the gateway.
• Data stewardship: User data is minimized and routed through vaults with explicit consent. Partners must honor retention windows and support revocation requests.

Investor proposition

• Category creation: The Aggregator Platform establishes a new infrastructure layer: composable micro‑apps as embeddable widgets, discoverable via a catalog, enforced by a governance gateway.
• Scalable market breadth: Applicable across media, sports, gaming, education, creator economy, fintech, and civic engagement — wherever modular participation and incentives matter.
• Economic engine: Stable token ledger supports staking, rewards, revenue share, and escrow. Quality and compliance raise reputation multipliers, increasing developer and partner earnings.
• Defensible IP: Examiner‑ready architecture: function manifests (consent scopes, pricing, SLA), gateway policy enforcement (purpose binding, residency), staking tiers, and dispute resolution flows.
• Network effects: More developers → richer catalog → higher partner adoption → increased user engagement → token velocity and platform TVL.
• Risk management: Built‑in consent, audit trails, and optional KYC/AML; dispute resolution and escrow limit downside while preserving user trust.

Value proposition

For developers

• Publish and monetize: Ship independent functions as services + widgets; set pricing (per‑call/session/outcome) and revenue splits.
• Operational rigor: Automated tests, SBOMs, security scans, and staged releases (canary→beta→GA).
• Reputation and rewards: Tamper‑evident attestations drive listing priority and revenue multipliers.


For partners

• Plug‑and‑play: Embed themeable widgets or call via server proxy; mix‑and‑match functions without heavy lift.
• Consent‑aware UX: Built‑in prompts with revocation and purpose binding; regional residency controls.
• Shared economics: Transparent revenue splits; staking tiers unlock throughput and fee reductions.


For users

• Control and clarity: Revocable consent tokens, clear purpose/retention, and audit visibility.
• Meaningful participation: Tokenized rewards for participation and transparent settlement flows.
• Trust by design: Least‑privilege data flows and dispute resolution options.

Why this platform wins

• Layered architecture:• Trust & Governance (consent, reputation, audit).
• Economic & Social Engagement (voting, tipping, competitions, chat).
• Extensibility (marketplace of widgets and partner integrations).

• Speed to adoption: Partners integrate in hours; developers publish in days; users onboard in minutes.
• Regulatory resilience: Consent‑first flows, residency enforcement, and optional KYC make high‑value categories viable.

Funding requirements and use of proceeds

• Seed round target: $1.5M — runway 12–18 months to MVP commercialization.• Platform engineering (40%): core gateway hardening, scalable runtimes, CI/CD and SBOM automation, observability, test suites, and reliability engineering.
• Compliance and legal (15%): jurisdictional assessments, KYC/AML integrations, regulatory counsel for wagering and escrow, and SOC2 readiness.
• Product and UX (15%): widget library expansion, partner embed flows, sandbox environments, and developer portal polish.
• Market development (15%): partner pilots, developer incentives, grants, and initial commercial partnerships.
• Operations and security (10%): cloud infra, security audits, image signing, and incident response readiness.

• Series A target (18–24 months): $6–10M — scale commercialization, global compliance, marketplace growth, and enterprise features.• Regional expansion and compliance packs (30%): build country/regional residency enforcement and KYC provider integrations for major markets.
• Enterprise features (25%): advanced SLAs, private deployments, audit packaging, and single‑sign‑on integrations.
• Marketplace growth (25%): marketplace curation, incentives, accelerator programs for developers, and revenue share diversification.
• Platform security and legal (10%): continuous assurance, pentesting, and IP protection.
• Go‑to‑market and partnerships (10%): channel sales, strategic alliances, and marketplace co‑selling.

• Milestones tied to funding:• Seed close → deliver catalog MVP, consent engine v1, basic staking, and 3 partner pilots.
• Post‑seed (6–12 months) → secure 10 production partners, 50 published functions, and TVL target for token flows.
• Series A → enterprise customers, multi‑region compliance, and an audited SOC2 report.

Quick start and contribution notes

• Clone and compose: docker compose up --build to launch gateway, functions, frontend, Postgres, and Redis.
• Explore catalog: Visit the frontend to browse and try functions; manifests are in /manifests.
• Submit a function: Include a manifest (inputs/outputs, consent scopes, pricing, SLA), tests, and compliance notes.
• Security & compliance: Provide SBOMs for GA releases and note any residency/KYC requirements.
